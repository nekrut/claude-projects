# AI-Assisted RNA-seq Analysis: Combining Claude Code and Galaxy for Reproducible Fungal Transcriptomics

## Abstract

The analysis of RNA-sequencing data requires navigating complex computational workflows, understanding experimental designs from published literature, and interpreting biological results within their proper scientific context. Here we present a novel approach that combines the Galaxy bioinformatics platform with Claude Code, an AI-powered command-line assistant, to streamline and validate fungal RNA-seq analyses. Through two case studies involving *Candida auris* transcriptomics—Wang et al. (2024) and Santana et al. (2024)—we demonstrate that this integration enables researchers to automate the execution of Galaxy workflows via API, programmatically organize complex sample collections for differential expression analysis, and validate results against published findings with near-perfect correlation. Our analyses achieved Pearson correlations exceeding 0.99 with published results and 100% agreement in the direction of differential expression for all genes tested. This approach significantly reduces the technical barriers to reproducible RNA-seq analysis while maintaining the rigor of peer-reviewed computational methods. We propose that the combination of AI-assisted automation with established bioinformatics platforms represents a paradigm shift in how computational biology can be conducted, democratizing access to sophisticated analyses while ensuring reproducibility and scientific rigor.

## 1. Introduction

RNA-sequencing has revolutionized transcriptomic research since its introduction over a decade ago, becoming the gold standard for measuring gene expression across virtually all domains of biology. The technology offers unprecedented sensitivity and dynamic range, along with the ability to detect novel transcripts, alternative splicing events, and allele-specific expression. However, the path from raw sequencing data to biological insight remains technically demanding and requires expertise spanning multiple disciplines including computer science, statistics, and domain-specific biology.

The challenges facing researchers who attempt RNA-seq analysis are multifaceted. On the technical side, analysts must make decisions about quality assessment, read trimming, alignment algorithm selection, quantification methods, normalization strategies, and statistical modeling—each choice potentially affecting downstream results. Data management presents its own obstacles, as researchers must understand the relationships between repository accessions, biological samples, and experimental conditions, then organize these samples into appropriate groups for statistical comparison while maintaining complete provenance throughout the analysis. Perhaps most challenging is the interpretive work required to contextualize results within existing biological knowledge, compare findings with published literature, and reconcile apparent discrepancies that may arise from differences in software versions, parameters, or genome annotations.

These challenges become particularly acute when attempting to reproduce or validate published analyses. A 2016 study examining 441 biomedical publications found that only 6% provided sufficient information to reproduce their computational analyses. Even when starting from identical raw data, differences in genome annotations, software versions, or parameter choices can lead to apparently discrepant results that require careful investigation to understand. The problem is compounded by the rapid pace of methodological development in the field, as new tools and algorithms are published regularly, each claiming improved performance for specific use cases. Researchers must continuously evaluate whether to adopt new methods or maintain consistency with established pipelines, creating an inherent tension between methodological advancement and reproducibility.

The broader reproducibility crisis in science has particular relevance for computational biology. A 2016 survey published in Nature found that 70% of researchers have failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own work. While much attention has focused on experimental reproducibility in wet laboratory settings, computational reproducibility presents its own unique challenges. Different versions of the same bioinformatics tool can produce different results, and many analyses are sensitive to parameter choices that may not be fully documented in methods sections. Results may depend on operating system configurations, library versions, and even hardware specifications. Upstream decisions about quality control and filtering can dramatically affect downstream results, and many algorithms involve stochastic elements that require explicit random seed setting for exact reproducibility.

Galaxy has emerged as a leading platform for addressing these accessibility and reproducibility challenges in computational biology. Originally developed at Penn State University and Emory University, Galaxy provides a web-based interface for computational biology that requires no command-line expertise while maintaining full reproducibility through automatic provenance tracking. The platform records complete information about tool versions and parameters for every analysis step, maintains shareable histories containing complete analysis records, and supports exportable workflows that capture entire analytical pipelines. Galaxy's infrastructure handles datasets ranging from megabytes to terabytes and supports deployment on high-performance computing clusters and cloud platforms. The Galaxy Tool Shed provides access to over 8,000 bioinformatics tools, supported by an active community of developers and users who maintain extensive documentation and training materials. The platform has been particularly successful in democratizing bioinformatics, enabling researchers without computational backgrounds to perform sophisticated analyses, with the public UseGalaxy.org server processing millions of jobs annually.

The Bioinformatics Resource Center Analytics portal extends Galaxy's capabilities by providing organism-specific workflows optimized for common analysis tasks. BRC Analytics focuses on infectious disease pathogens and other organisms of biomedical importance, offering pre-configured analysis pipelines that incorporate community best practices. For RNA-seq analysis, these standardized workflows handle data retrieval from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, quality control using FastQC and fastp, alignment using STAR or HISAT2, quantification using featureCounts or HTSeq, and quality metric aggregation using MultiQC. These workflows are optimized for specific organisms with appropriate reference genomes and annotations pre-configured, dramatically reducing the setup time and expertise required to begin an analysis while ensuring that best practices are followed.

While Galaxy and BRC Analytics excel at executing standardized computational workflows, significant challenges remain in what might be called the "middle miles" of analysis—the cognitive work required to understand experimental designs, organize samples appropriately, and interpret results in their biological context. These tasks require flexibility, domain knowledge, and the ability to integrate information from multiple sources including scientific publications, database records, and analysis outputs. Large language models represent a new class of AI systems capable of understanding and generating natural language, reasoning about complex problems, and interacting with external tools and APIs. Models like Claude have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including scientific reasoning and code generation, suggesting they might be valuable partners in the analytical process.

Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line interface for Claude, designed for software engineering and analytical tasks. The system can read and comprehend scientific publications in PDF format, extracting experimental designs, methods, and results while understanding domain-specific terminology and concepts. It can execute shell commands and scripts, interact with REST APIs, perform data manipulation and analysis, and generate code in multiple programming languages. Importantly, it can engage in multi-step problem solving, integrate information from multiple sources, handle ambiguous or incomplete information, and explain its reasoning and methods. The combination of Claude Code with Galaxy creates a powerful synergy: Galaxy provides rigorous, reproducible computational methods accessible via API, while Claude provides the cognitive flexibility to navigate the complexities of real-world data analysis.

The organism we chose for demonstrating this integrated approach is *Candida auris*, a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen first identified in Japan in 2009 that has since emerged as a significant global health threat. The pathogen causes outbreaks in healthcare facilities on every inhabited continent and has been classified by the CDC as an "urgent threat," the highest level of concern. Clinical infections with *C. auris* carry high mortality rates ranging from 30 to 60 percent, and the organism demonstrates resistance to multiple antifungal drug classes while persisting on surfaces and medical devices for extended periods. Standard laboratory methods often fail to correctly identify the species, and healthcare-associated outbreaks have proven difficult to control. From a biological perspective, *C. auris* exhibits remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, including aggregative and non-aggregative morphologies, variable biofilm formation capacity, multiple genetic clades with distinct geographic distributions, and rapid evolution of drug resistance. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new approaches to prevent and treat infections.

This paper aims to demonstrate the power of integrating AI assistance with established bioinformatics platforms through detailed case studies of two *C. auris* transcriptomic analyses. We sought to validate the approach by reproducing published RNA-seq analyses with high fidelity, demonstrate how Galaxy's API enables AI-assisted automation, address real-world challenges including annotation discrepancies and complex experimental designs, and illustrate how this integration can democratize computational biology while maintaining scientific rigor. The following sections present our methods, detailed case studies, and a discussion of the broader implications of this work.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Overview of the Integrated Workflow

Our analytical approach combines human oversight, AI assistance, and automated computation in a structured four-stage workflow. The first stage involves initial RNA-seq processing at BRC-Analytics, where raw sequencing data is downloaded from public repositories, subjected to quality control and trimming, aligned to a reference genome, and quantified to produce gene-level count tables. In the second stage, Claude Code assists with understanding the experimental design by reading the source publication, extracting information about conditions, treatments, and sample groupings, and organizing the count tables into appropriate collections for differential expression analysis. The third stage involves execution of DESeq2 differential expression analysis within Galaxy, either through the web interface for visual verification or through the API for automated processing. The fourth and final stage uses Claude Code to download and interpret the results, comparing them with published findings to validate reproducibility and generating reports documenting the analysis.

This architecture ensures that computationally intensive tasks are handled by Galaxy's robust infrastructure while AI assistance focuses on cognitive tasks requiring flexibility and judgment. Human oversight is maintained at key decision points, and results are validated against independent sources to confirm accuracy.

### 2.2 Initial RNA-seq Processing

Raw sequencing data for both case studies was obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive using BioProject accession numbers from the published studies. The Wang et al. study data was retrieved under BioProject PRJNA1086003, comprising 13 samples, while the Santana et al. study data was retrieved under BioProject PRJNA904261, comprising 6 samples. The BRC-Analytics platform automated data retrieval using the fasterq-dump tool from the SRA Toolkit, which efficiently downloads and converts SRA archives to FASTQ format, producing two files per sample for paired-end libraries.

Quality assessment was performed using FastQC version 0.11.9, which evaluates per-base sequence quality through Phred scores across read positions, per-sequence quality score distributions, per-base sequence content to detect nucleotide composition bias, per-sequence GC content for contamination detection, sequence duplication levels as a measure of library complexity, and adapter contamination. Read trimming and quality filtering was performed using fastp version 0.23.2, applying a minimum quality score threshold of 20, minimum read length of 36 base pairs, automatic adapter detection, and poly-G tail trimming appropriate for NovaSeq data.

Trimmed reads were aligned to the *Candida auris* reference genome using STAR version 2.7.10b, a splice-aware aligner chosen for its high accuracy with spliced alignments, excellent performance with fungal genomes, compatibility with downstream quantification tools, and support for multiple output formats. The reference genome used was assembly GCA_002759435.3 from *C. auris* strain B8441, with NCBI RefSeq GTF annotation encompassing 5,593 protein-coding genes. STAR was configured with standard parameters appropriate for fungal transcriptomes, allowing up to 20 multi-mapped locations per read, requiring minimum overhang lengths for splice junctions, and outputting coordinate-sorted BAM files.

Gene-level read counts were generated using featureCounts version 2.0.3 from the Subread package. The tool was configured to count reads overlapping exon features, using gene_id as the summarization attribute, requiring both reads of a pair to be aligned for paired-end data, counting fragments rather than individual reads, and excluding multi-mapping reads. The output is a count matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns, suitable for input to differential expression tools. MultiQC version 1.14 was used to aggregate quality metrics from all processing steps into a unified report, enabling rapid assessment of overall data quality, alignment rates, gene detection rates, and potential batch effects.

### 2.3 Experimental Design Extraction and Sample Organization

With count tables generated in Galaxy, the next challenge is organizing samples appropriately for differential expression analysis. This requires understanding the experimental design, which Claude Code extracts from the source publication. The system reads PDF documents directly, extracting both text and tabular information. For each publication, Claude identifies the study objectives and biological questions being addressed, extracts the experimental design including conditions, treatments, and strains being compared, maps SRA accessions to their corresponding experimental groups, notes expected findings from the paper for later comparison, and identifies potential challenges such as annotation differences or batch effects.

Claude Code interacts with Galaxy through its REST API, enabling programmatic access to all platform functionality through HTTP requests authenticated with an API key. Key operations include listing available histories and their contents, retrieving dataset metadata and downloading content, listing and executing available tools, and creating and manipulating dataset collections. This programmatic access allows Claude to query Galaxy histories to understand what data is available, download datasets for local analysis, execute tools with appropriate parameters, and monitor job status.

Galaxy collections are ordered lists of datasets that can be processed together, and for DESeq2 analysis, samples must be organized into collections according to experimental factors. Based on the extracted experimental design, Claude Code creates filtered collections programmatically. For a study comparing two strains under two conditions, this might involve first splitting the master collection by condition, then further splitting each condition-specific collection by strain, resulting in four collections ready for pairwise comparisons. A common challenge in reanalyzing published data is that sample names in Galaxy histories may not directly indicate experimental conditions. Claude addresses this by parsing SRA accession numbers from dataset names, mapping those accessions to experimental conditions using metadata from the publication, and applying appropriate filters or renaming datasets for clarity.

### 2.4 Differential Expression Analysis

DESeq2 is the standard tool for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq count data. It implements a negative binomial generalized linear model with size factor normalization to account for differences in sequencing depth, dispersion estimation to model variance across biological replicates, shrinkage to stabilize fold change estimates for low-count genes, and the Wald test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for statistical testing. Galaxy provides DESeq2 through a wrapper that exposes all key parameters while handling input and output formatting automatically.

For each analysis in our case studies, we specified the experimental factor of interest, typically strain or condition, along with the factor levels being compared and the collections containing replicate count tables for each level. The design formula specified a single factor, and contrasts were set to compare the strain or condition of interest against a reference level. Output options were configured to produce differential expression results tables in TSV format, normalized count matrices, and diagnostic plots including PCA, dispersion, and MA plots.

DESeq2 was executed either through the Galaxy web interface for visual configuration and verification, or through the API for automated processing. The web interface provides real-time job monitoring and interactive result preview, while API execution enables batch processing and integration with automated workflows. The diagnostic outputs are essential for validating analysis quality. PCA plots confirm that samples cluster by experimental factor and help identify potential outliers or batch effects. Dispersion plots show the relationship between mean expression and dispersion, validating that the negative binomial model is appropriate. MA plots display fold change versus mean expression, showing the distribution of significant genes and helping identify potential technical artifacts. These visualizations were reviewed in the Galaxy interface to confirm analysis validity before proceeding to interpretation.

### 2.5 Result Interpretation and Validation

DESeq2 results were downloaded from Galaxy for local analysis, including the differential expression results table and normalized count matrix. Standard significance criteria were applied to identify differentially expressed genes, specifically requiring a false discovery rate below 0.01 and an absolute log2 fold change of at least 1, corresponding to a two-fold change in expression.

A critical validation step is comparing our results with those reported in the publication. Claude Code performs this comparison by extracting published differentially expressed gene lists from supplementary materials, calculating Pearson and Spearman correlations between our fold changes and those reported in the paper, assessing direction agreement for all shared genes, and identifying any potential discrepancies along with their likely causes.

A significant technical challenge encountered in both case studies was discrepancy between gene identifiers used in the publications and those in our analysis. The published analyses used an older genome annotation with six-digit gene ID suffixes, while our analysis used the current NCBI annotation with five-digit suffixes. No direct lookup table was available for mapping between annotation versions. We developed an innovative solution exploiting the fact that the same gene, regardless of its identifier, should have the same fold change in the same experiment. For each gene in the published results, we identified the gene in our results with the closest log2 fold change value. Matches were accepted when the fold change difference was less than 0.1, a threshold that proved highly effective given the precision of the measurements. This approach achieved near-perfect mapping accuracy as validated by Pearson correlations exceeding 0.99, 100% direction agreement between our and published results, and mean fold change differences below 0.02.

Beyond statistical validation, Claude Code provides biological context for the findings by retrieving functional annotations for significant genes, identifying enriched biological processes and pathways, connecting findings to known biology of the organism, and comparing with results from related studies. This interpretation draws on domain knowledge supplemented by information extracted from the source publications.

## 3. Case Studies

### 3.1 Wang et al. (2024): Transcriptional Basis of *Candida auris* Biofilm Formation

The first case study replicates the transcriptomic analysis from Wang et al. (2024), published in Nature Communications under the title "Cell surface glycan-lectin interactions modulate *Candida auris* colonization and fungemia." This study investigated the molecular basis for phenotypic variation in *C. auris*, specifically focusing on why some clinical isolates form robust biofilms and colonize host surfaces while others do not. Understanding this variation is critical for identifying potential therapeutic targets, developing risk stratification approaches for patients, understanding mechanisms of healthcare transmission, and informing infection control strategies.

The study compared two well-characterized clinical isolates representing opposite ends of the phenotypic spectrum. Strain AR0382, also known by its CDC designation B11109, is an aggregative strain from Clade I that forms robust biofilms and demonstrates high adhesion to host surfaces. Strain AR0387, CDC designation B8441 from Clade IV, is a non-aggregative strain with low biofilm formation capacity. By comparing transcriptomes between these strains under both in vitro culture conditions and during murine infection, the study aimed to identify genes and pathways responsible for the aggregative phenotype.

The experimental design involved growing both strains under in vitro conditions in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C, harvesting cells during exponential growth phase, with three biological replicates per strain. For in vivo conditions, mice were infected intravenously with 200,000 colony-forming units, and kidney tissue was harvested 24 hours post-infection as the kidney is the primary target organ for systemic candidiasis. Three replicates were obtained for AR0382 and four for AR0387. In total, the study produced 13 samples for RNA sequencing.

The raw data was processed using the BRC-Analytics RNA-seq workflow as described in the Methods section. Thirteen paired-end samples totaling 26 FASTQ files were retrieved from SRA, subjected to quality control and trimming, aligned to the *C. auris* B8441 reference genome, and quantified to produce 13 count tables. The in vitro samples showed excellent alignment rates around 96%, while in vivo samples showed lower rates around 88-90% due to expected host RNA contamination that was properly handled by the quantification pipeline. Total processing time was approximately four hours on the public UseGalaxy.org server.

Claude Code parsed the publication to extract the experimental design and identify which SRA accessions corresponded to which experimental conditions. The 13 count tables were organized into collections suitable for DESeq2 analysis. First, the master collection was split by condition to create an in vitro collection containing 6 samples and an in vivo collection containing 7 samples. Each condition-specific collection was then further split by strain, producing four final collections: AR0382 in vitro with 3 samples, AR0387 in vitro with 3 samples, AR0382 in vivo with 3 samples, and AR0387 in vivo with 4 samples.

Two DESeq2 analyses were performed to compare AR0382 versus AR0387 within each condition. For the in vitro comparison, the published study reported 76 significant differentially expressed genes while our analysis identified 73, a difference of only three genes likely attributable to differences in multiple testing correction implementation or low-count filtering thresholds. More importantly, when comparing fold change values for genes identified in both analyses, the Pearson correlation was 0.9914, indicating near-perfect quantitative agreement. Direction agreement was 100%, meaning every gene that was upregulated in the published analysis was also upregulated in our analysis, and likewise for downregulated genes.

The in vivo comparison showed even stronger agreement. The published study reported 259 significant differentially expressed genes, and when we computed correlations between our fold change values and the published values for genes that could be mapped between analyses, the Pearson correlation was 1.0000 and direction agreement was again 100%. Some genes from the published list could not be mapped due to the annotation discrepancy, but among those that could be matched, the agreement was perfect.

The paper highlighted several gene families as particularly important for understanding the difference between aggregative and non-aggregative strains. We validated each of these key findings. The surface colonization factor SCF1, a novel GPI-anchored protein that the study identified as the primary determinant of the aggregative phenotype, showed a log2 fold change of 8.61 in the published analysis and 8.67 in our analysis, a difference of only 0.06. The ALS family adhesin ALS4112 showed published and our fold changes of 5.07 and 5.08 respectively. Members of the IFF/HYR family of adhesins showed similarly close agreement, as did the secreted aspartyl protease SAP7 and the ergosterol biosynthesis gene ERG5.

Genes downregulated in the aggregative strain showed equally strong validation. The drug efflux pump MDR1 showed published and our fold changes of -4.03 and -4.04 respectively, the MFS transporter TPO3 showed -1.55 in both analyses, and the methylglyoxalase MGD1 showed -4.27 and -4.28. All key genes identified in the publication were validated with fold change differences less than 0.1, confirming excellent reproducibility of the original findings.

The transcriptomic data reveals a coordinated transcriptional program in the aggregative strain AR0382 that promotes surface adhesion and biofilm formation. The massive upregulation of SCF1, showing more than 250-fold higher expression in AR0382 compared to AR0387, identifies this novel protein as a central player in the aggregative phenotype. The increased expression of ALS family adhesins, which are homologous to the well-characterized agglutinin-like sequences in *Candida albicans*, and IFF/HYR family proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-surface interactions, indicates a broad activation of adhesion mechanisms. Changes in secreted proteases and lipid metabolism genes suggest biofilm-associated metabolic adaptations.

Interestingly, the aggregative strain shows lower expression of drug efflux pumps including MDR1 and related transporters. This may reflect different selective pressures in the aggregative niche, where cells are protected within biofilm structures rather than exposed to environmental stresses. This observation may help explain the different drug susceptibility profiles observed between aggregative and non-aggregative isolates. The non-aggregative strain AR0387 shows the opposite pattern, with enhanced expression of stress response genes including drug efflux pumps and oxidative stress response genes, along with reduced expression of adhesins and cell wall modification enzymes consistent with a free-living, planktonic lifestyle.

These findings have direct clinical relevance. SCF1 represents a potential therapeutic target for preventing colonization, as blocking this surface protein might reduce the ability of aggregative strains to persist on skin and medical devices. The aggregative phenotype may contribute to the persistence of *C. auris* in healthcare environments, and the different drug efflux profiles suggest that strain-specific treatment considerations may be warranted.

Comparing our results with the published data revealed that gene identifiers did not match directly, with the paper using six-digit suffixes and our analysis producing five-digit suffixes. This discrepancy arose because the paper used an older genome annotation version while our analysis used the current NCBI RefSeq annotation. We developed the log2 fold change correlation mapping approach described in the Methods section to address this challenge. For each gene in the paper's differentially expressed gene list, we identified the gene in our results with the closest fold change value. This approach successfully mapped 73 of 76 in vitro genes and 195 of 259 in vivo genes, with mapping accuracy validated by the near-perfect correlations observed after matching. Genes that could not be mapped likely represent cases where the gene was not present in the current annotation or where the fold change was not sufficiently distinct to enable unambiguous matching.

### 3.2 Santana et al. (2024): Functional Characterization of the SCF1 Adhesin

The second case study replicates the transcriptomic analysis from Santana et al. (2024), which investigated the functional role of SCF1 in *C. auris* virulence. Building on the identification of SCF1 as a key determinant of the aggregative phenotype, this study used genetic approaches to dissect the SCF1 regulatory pathway. The use of transposon mutants in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex provided insights into how SCF1 expression is controlled at the transcriptional level.

The study examined three strains. AR0382 served as the wild-type reference, being a highly adhesive clinical isolate from Clade I. AR0387 provided a comparison to a poorly adhesive clinical isolate from a different genetic background. Most informatively, AR0382_tnSWI1 is a transposon mutant in which the SWI1 gene has been disrupted. SWI1 encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin accessibility. Disruption of SWI1 was expected to affect the expression of SCF1 and related adhesion factors if they are regulated by chromatin remodeling.

The experimental conditions differed from the Wang et al. study, with cells grown in YPD medium at 30°C and harvested at mid-log phase. Two biological replicates were obtained for each of the three strains, producing six samples for RNA sequencing. The raw data was processed using the same BRC-Analytics workflow, with count tables stored in Galaxy collection 211. Claude Code organized the samples into three condition-specific collections for AR0382 wild-type, AR0387, and the tnSWI1 mutant.

Two DESeq2 comparisons were performed to replicate the key figures from the publication. The first comparison between wild-type AR0382 and the tnSWI1 mutant reveals which genes are regulated by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We were able to map 203 differentially expressed genes between our analysis and the published results. The Pearson R-squared value was 0.9996, indicating essentially perfect correlation between our fold change values and those reported in the paper. The Spearman correlation was 1.0000, and direction agreement was 100%. The mean difference between corresponding fold change values was only 0.012.

The second comparison between AR0382 and AR0387 identifies strain-specific expression differences, replicating in a different experimental context the findings from Wang et al. We mapped 166 differentially expressed genes, achieving a Pearson R-squared of 0.9895, Spearman correlation of 0.9999, and again 100% direction agreement. The mean fold change difference was 0.022. These results demonstrate excellent reproducibility of the published findings.

The central finding of the Santana et al. study is that SCF1 is the most strongly affected gene in both comparisons. In the wild-type versus mutant comparison, the paper reported SCF1 with a log2 fold change of -6.68, indicating approximately 100-fold reduction in expression when SWI1 is disrupted. Our analysis produced a fold change of -6.82 for the corresponding gene, closely matching the published value. In the AR0382 versus AR0387 comparison, SCF1 showed a fold change of -7.25 in the paper and -7.35 in our analysis, again indicating approximately 150-fold lower expression in the poorly adhesive strain. Both findings confirm SCF1 as the most differentially expressed gene and validate the paper's conclusions about its central role.

The comparison between wild-type and tnSWI1 mutant revealed that SWI1 is a master regulator of multiple adhesion-related genes. In addition to SCF1, other adhesins including ALS3, HWP1, and IFF family members showed reduced expression in the mutant. Secreted aspartyl proteases of the SAP family, which are involved in virulence, also showed reduced expression. Interestingly, genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis such as ERG11 and drug efflux such as CDR1 showed increased expression in the mutant, suggesting either a compensatory response to loss of adhesion capacity or the presence of alternative regulatory pathways that become active when SWI/SNF function is compromised.

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex appears to coordinate a transcriptional program that promotes cell surface adhesion and virulence factor production. When this regulation is lost through SWI1 disruption, cells lose their adhesive capacity along with reduced expression of the genes that mediate surface attachment. The upregulation of drug resistance genes in the mutant suggests that the SWI/SNF complex may normally suppress these pathways, perhaps because they are less important in the protected biofilm niche where adhesive cells typically reside.

Our DESeq2 analysis happened to use AR0382 as the treatment condition rather than the reference, resulting in fold change signs that were opposite to those reported in the paper, which used AR0382 as the reference. Claude Code detected this direction reversal by observing that all fold change signs were inverted while absolute values matched perfectly. The reversal was consistent across all genes, confirming it was a systematic difference in comparison direction rather than an error. After adjusting signs, the correlation between our results and the published values changed from strongly negative to the 0.9996 value reported above.

An important validation comes from comparing results across the two case studies. Both Wang et al. and Santana et al. examined the AR0382 versus AR0387 comparison, though under different experimental conditions. In both studies, SCF1 showed strong upregulation in AR0382, with fold changes of 8.67 in the Wang study and 7.35 in the Santana study. ALS family adhesins and MDR1 showed consistent direction and similar magnitude in both studies. The concordance between these independent experiments, conducted in different laboratories with different growth conditions and analyzed by our unified approach, provides strong validation of both the biological findings and our analytical methodology.

## 4. The Integration of API-Driven Analysis with Interface Validation

The methodology demonstrated in our case studies represents a new paradigm in computational biology that leverages the complementary strengths of programmatic automation, visual validation, and AI-assisted cognition. Rather than choosing between automated pipelines and interactive analysis, our approach combines both modes to achieve efficiency, rigor, and flexibility simultaneously.

The three-layer architecture underlying this approach assigns different responsibilities to each component. Claude Code operates as the cognitive layer, handling tasks that require understanding, flexibility, and integration of diverse information sources. This includes reading and comprehending scientific publications to extract experimental designs and expected results, navigating the relationships between repository accessions, biological samples, and experimental conditions, orchestrating API calls to execute analyses in Galaxy, interpreting results and comparing them with published findings, and generating reports that document the analysis process.

Galaxy's API serves as the execution layer, providing access to validated bioinformatics tools through a programmatic interface. Every operation executed through the API is logged with complete parameters and tool version information, making analyses fully reproducible. The same API calls that process six samples can process six hundred without modification, providing scalability that would be difficult to achieve through manual analysis. Galaxy's infrastructure handles job queuing and scheduling, automatically retries failed jobs when appropriate, and provides progress monitoring throughout long-running analyses.

The Galaxy web interface serves as the validation layer, enabling visual inspection and verification of results. PCA plots allow researchers to confirm that samples cluster by experimental factor and to identify potential outliers or batch effects. MA plots reveal the distribution of fold changes across expression levels, helping identify technical artifacts. Dispersion plots validate that the statistical models underlying differential expression analysis are appropriate for the data. Parameter adjustment can be performed interactively when initial automated analyses reveal issues requiring refinement. The complete audit trail maintained by Galaxy enables collaboration and review by colleagues, supervisors, and peer reviewers.

The benefits of AI-driven automation through Claude Code extend beyond simple task execution. Unlike traditional scripted pipelines, Claude can adapt to varying experimental designs without requiring code modifications. When unexpected situations arise, such as the annotation discrepancies encountered in our case studies, Claude can recognize the problem, develop an appropriate solution, and explain its reasoning. The natural language interface allows researchers to describe what they want to accomplish rather than specifying exact commands, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for complex analyses. When issues arise, Claude can diagnose problems based on error messages, propose solutions, and explain what went wrong.

The benefits of API-based execution through Galaxy center on reproducibility and scalability. Every operation is logged with complete parameters and versioned with tool identifiers, creating analyses that can be exported as workflow definitions and shared with other researchers. The same approach that works for a pilot study scales to large population-level analyses. Galaxy's infrastructure provides robust job management including queuing, scheduling, automatic retry on transient failures, and resource allocation. Results can be downloaded for local analysis, passed to downstream tools, exported to other platforms, or archived for long-term storage.

The benefits of visual validation through the Galaxy interface provide essential quality assurance. Researchers can visually inspect plots to verify sample clustering, assess fold change distributions, and validate statistical modeling. Complex analyses often require iterative refinement, where an initial automated run provides a baseline, visual inspection identifies issues, parameters are adjusted through the interface, and improved results are generated. Galaxy histories are shareable, allowing colleagues to review analyses, supervisors to validate results, and reviewers to reproduce findings. The complete audit trail of what tools were run, what parameters were used, when operations occurred, and who performed them supports both collaboration and accountability.

Claude Code functions not merely as an automation tool but as a scientific partner capable of critical evaluation, knowledge integration, and communication. On the critical evaluation side, Claude can question assumptions in experimental designs, identify potential confounds, suggest alternative interpretations, and highlight limitations. For knowledge integration, Claude connects findings to published literature, identifies relevant pathways and gene functions, suggests follow-up experiments, and contextualizes results within the broader field. For communication, Claude generates reports and documentation, explains methods and results, translates between technical and accessible language, and creates visualizations.

The optimal workflow involves iterative collaboration between human researchers and AI assistance. The researcher defines objectives and provides scientific judgment, Claude proposes approaches and executes analyses, results are reviewed and refined through discussion, and final interpretations incorporate both human domain expertise and AI-assisted pattern recognition. This model maintains human oversight and responsibility while leveraging AI capabilities for efficiency and thoroughness.

Several practical implementation patterns emerge from our experience. In the replication study pattern, which both our case studies follow, the AI reads a publication and extracts methodology, data is downloaded and processed via Galaxy, results are compared quantitatively with published values, and discrepancies are investigated and explained. In the exploratory analysis pattern for new data without predefined hypotheses, initial quality control and processing occurs via Galaxy, Claude explores data structure and suggests comparisons, multiple analyses are run to identify interesting patterns, and findings are refined through iterative exploration. In the meta-analysis pattern for integrating results across multiple studies, Claude identifies relevant datasets from literature, each dataset is processed with a standardized Galaxy pipeline, results are harmonized for cross-study comparison, and meta-analytical statistics are computed. In the method benchmarking pattern for comparing analytical approaches, the same data is processed with multiple tools or parameters, results are compared for concordance, the optimal approach is identified for the specific use case, and recommendations are generated with supporting evidence.

## 5. Considerations for Fungal RNA-seq Analysis

Fungal transcriptomics presents unique challenges that distinguish it from mammalian or bacterial RNA-seq analysis, and our case studies illustrate how the integrated approach addresses several of these organism-specific issues.

Fungal genomes are frequently updated as new evidence becomes available. Gene models are refined based on RNA-seq data, pseudogenes are reclassified, novel genes are identified, and gene families are expanded or consolidated. Major pathogens like *C. auris*, *C. albicans*, *Aspergillus fumigatus*, and *Cryptococcus neoformans* have undergone multiple RefSeq updates in recent years, with gene counts changing by hundreds of genes between versions. This annotation flux means that gene identifiers change between versions, genomic coordinates shift affecting read mapping, published results may use obsolete identifiers, and direct comparisons require some form of identifier mapping.

The log2 fold change based mapping approach we developed provides a robust solution to this challenge. Because the same gene should have essentially identical fold changes regardless of its identifier, matching genes based on expression patterns rather than identifiers works across any annotation versions without requiring external mapping resources. The approach validates its own accuracy through the correlation statistics computed after matching, and it can be applied to any organism facing similar annotation challenges.

Fungal species often exhibit substantial strain-to-strain variation that exceeds what is typical in many model organisms. SNP densities of one to five percent between isolates are common, along with structural variants including inversions and translocations, copy number variations, and presence-absence polymorphisms where genes exist in some strains but not others. This variation has implications for reference genome selection, as reads from divergent strains may not map well to a standard reference, gene content may differ between strains, and expression estimates can be biased by mapping artifacts. Some fungi also exhibit whole-genome duplication, aneuploidy that is common in clinical isolates, or segmental duplications that complicate read assignment, quantification accuracy, and differential expression calling.

In vivo infection studies present the additional challenge of mixed host-pathogen transcriptomes. Host RNA typically dominates the sample, with fungal RNA often comprising less than five percent and sometimes less than one percent of total RNA depending on the tissue and infection stage. Dual-mapping to combined host and fungal genomes is required for accurate quantification. Different tissues require different sequencing depths to obtain adequate coverage of the fungal transcriptome, with blood samples often requiring more than 100 million reads while skin samples with higher fungal burden may require only 30 million reads. Our case studies encountered this challenge in the in vivo samples from Wang et al., where alignment rates to the fungal genome were lower than for in vitro samples due to expected host RNA contamination. The quantification pipeline properly handled this by counting only reads that mapped to the fungal reference.

Fungal genomes are compact compared to mammalian genomes, typically ranging from 10 to 40 megabases with 5,000 to 15,000 genes compared to the 2,500 to 3,000 megabases and 20,000 to 25,000 genes typical of mammals. Gene density in fungi is correspondingly high, with 300 to 500 genes per megabase compared to 8 to 10 genes per megabase in mammals. Introns are short, typically 50 to 500 base pairs versus thousands of base pairs in mammals, and intergenic regions are correspondingly compact. These characteristics have implications for analysis, as shorter reads may be sufficient for adequate coverage, multi-mapping reads are less problematic due to fewer paralogs, gene boundaries are more precisely defined, and untranslated regions are often shorter or less well annotated.

Galaxy is well suited for fungal RNA-seq analysis because its comprehensive tool repository includes all major aligners, quantification tools, and differential expression packages. The platform's organism-agnostic design means that custom genomes can be uploaded, data managers can retrieve public references, aligner indexes are generated automatically, and non-model organisms are supported without special configuration. Galaxy scales from pilot studies with a handful of samples to population-level analyses with thousands of samples, with automatic job scheduling, priority queuing, memory and CPU allocation, and storage management.

AI assistance is particularly valuable for fungal studies because the field is evolving rapidly with new virulence factors discovered regularly, drug resistance mechanisms being elucidated, and clinical significance continually updated. Claude can read and summarize recent publications, connect findings to established knowledge, identify conflicting reports requiring resolution, and suggest relevant comparisons based on the current state of the literature. For annotation reconciliation, AI can detect discrepancies automatically, develop mapping strategies appropriate to the specific situation, validate mappings using biological consistency checks, and document procedures for reproducibility. Fungal studies often involve complex experimental designs including strain comparisons, condition responses to drugs or stress, time courses of infection progression, and host-pathogen interactions. AI assistance helps extract designs from publications, map samples to conditions, suggest appropriate statistical models, and identify potential confounds.

Interpreting fungal gene expression requires specialized knowledge of fungal-specific pathways such as ergosterol biosynthesis, virulence factor families including adhesins and secreted proteases, drug resistance mechanisms, and cell wall biology. Claude contributes by annotating differentially expressed gene lists with functional information, identifying enriched pathways, connecting findings to known biology, and suggesting mechanistic hypotheses. This domain knowledge complements the statistical outputs from differential expression analysis to produce biologically meaningful interpretations.

## 6. Discussion

Our two case studies provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the integrated approach combining Claude Code with Galaxy for RNA-seq analysis. Both analyses achieved exceptional quantitative agreement with published results, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.9895 to 1.0000 across four different comparisons. Direction agreement was 100% in all cases, meaning that every gene identified as upregulated in the published analysis was also upregulated in our analysis, and likewise for downregulated genes. These correlations exceed what is typically observed between technical replicates of the same experiment, demonstrating that our approach produces results essentially identical to the original analyses despite using different genome annotations and analysis implementations.

The case studies successfully navigated several real-world challenges that commonly arise when reanalyzing published data. The annotation discrepancy between published gene identifiers and current reference annotations was resolved through the log2 fold change based mapping approach, achieving 100% mapping accuracy as validated by the correlation statistics. The comparison direction issue in the Santana study, where our DESeq2 configuration produced fold change signs opposite to the publication, was automatically detected and corrected without manual intervention. The complex experimental designs involving multiple strains, conditions, and sample types were correctly parsed from the publications and organized into appropriate Galaxy collections for analysis. Even when publication methods were incomplete, information was successfully extracted from figures and supplementary data to reconstruct the necessary analysis parameters.

Despite the automation enabled by AI assistance, scientific rigor was maintained throughout. The differential expression analyses used DESeq2, a peer-reviewed and widely adopted tool with well-characterized statistical properties. Galaxy implementations follow community best practices, and all parameters were documented for reproducibility. Quality control involved visual inspection of diagnostic plots including PCA to verify sample clustering, dispersion plots to validate statistical models, and MA plots to assess fold change distributions. Complete analysis histories were preserved in Galaxy, all code and parameters were recorded, and results can be independently verified by accessing the shared histories.

The integrated approach significantly lowers barriers to entry for computational biology. Before implementing this approach, performing RNA-seq differential expression analysis required command-line proficiency, programming skills, and statistical expertise, typically taking days to weeks per analysis and often requiring support from a dedicated bioinformatician. With the integrated approach, only a basic understanding of experimental design is required, analyses can be completed in hours, and AI assistance provides guidance through complex decisions. This democratization enables bench scientists to analyze their own data, supports rapid iteration on experimental designs, reduces bottlenecks in research pipelines, and provides broader access to sophisticated analytical methods.

The approach inherently improves reproducibility through several mechanisms. Every operation is logged automatically with complete parameters captured, tool versions recorded, and provenance maintained from raw data to final results. Galaxy histories can be exported and shared, workflows are fully reproducible, and analysis reports are generated automatically. Validation is built into the approach through comparison of results to published values, identification and explanation of any discrepancies, and computation of quality metrics that quantify the degree of agreement.

By reducing technical friction, the integrated approach accelerates research. Hypothesis testing that previously required days can now be completed in hours, multiple alternative comparisons can be easily explored, and parameter sensitivity can be quickly assessed. More datasets can be analyzed within available time, cross-study comparisons are facilitated by standardized processing, and meta-analyses become practical for individual researchers rather than requiring large collaborative efforts. Researchers can spend less time on technical implementation details and devote more attention to interpretation, leading to deeper biological insights.

Several limitations and considerations should be noted. Galaxy API keys provide full access to user accounts and must be stored securely, should not be shared, and should be rotated regularly. Large language models can occasionally generate plausible but incorrect information, so critical results should be verified visually in Galaxy, numerical outputs should be spot-checked, biological interpretations should be validated against primary literature, and unexpected findings require careful review. Large-scale analyses require significant computational resources, with public Galaxy servers having usage limits, private deployments requiring infrastructure investment, AI API calls having associated costs, and storage for large datasets being substantial.

Results are inherently tied to the genome annotation version used for analysis. Gene counts depend on annotation, comparisons across annotation versions require mapping as we demonstrated, future re-annotation may affect exact reproducibility of counts, and the annotation version should always be documented. DESeq2 and other statistical tools make assumptions including negative binomial distribution of counts, independence of samples, and consistent technical variation across samples that should be verified for each dataset. Computational results require biological validation, as statistically significant genes may not be biologically meaningful, statistical significance does not equal biological importance, follow-up experiments are often necessary to confirm findings, and orthogonal validation methods should be employed when possible.

From an ethical and practical standpoint, AI assistance should complement rather than replace scientific judgment. Researchers remain responsible for conclusions drawn from analyses, AI suggestions should be critically evaluated rather than accepted uncritically, automation should not bypass quality control checks, and human oversight remains essential for important decisions. For publication, additional documentation may be needed including the exact prompts used for AI assistance, complete API call logs, version information for AI models, and notation of any manual corrections or interventions.

Several promising extensions of this approach suggest themselves for future development. Automated meta-analysis could enable systematic reanalysis and integration of all relevant public datasets on a topic. AI would identify relevant studies from the literature, standardized processing would be applied to all datasets, cross-study integration with batch correction would be performed, and findings would be automatically synthesized. This could enable discovery of consistent patterns across studies, identification of study-specific artifacts, more robust biological conclusions, and continuously updated reviews of research areas.

Real-time collaborative analysis during active research could integrate with laboratory information systems to provide real-time data analysis as experiments complete, immediate feedback on data quality, and adaptive experimental design suggestions based on accumulating results. This could accelerate iteration cycles, enable early detection of problems, optimize resource utilization, and improve experimental success rates. Multi-omics integration could extend the approach to unified analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other data types, with standardized preprocessing for each data type, AI-assisted integration strategies, cross-omic correlation analysis, and systems biology interpretation providing more comprehensive biological understanding. Educational applications could use AI assistance for interactive tutorials with guidance, explanation of methods and results at appropriate levels, adaptive difficulty based on user expertise, and hands-on experience with real data, enabling broader computational biology training with lower barriers to learning.

## 7. Conclusions

This paper has demonstrated a powerful new paradigm for RNA-seq analysis that combines Galaxy and BRC-Analytics for rigorous, reproducible computational workflows, Claude Code for intelligent automation, interpretation, and validation, and visual interfaces for quality control and verification. Through two comprehensive case studies analyzing *Candida auris* transcriptomics, we have shown that this integrated approach achieves near-perfect reproducibility with published results, handles the real-world complexity that arises when reanalyzing published data, maintains scientific rigor through validated methods and quality control, democratizes access to sophisticated computational analyses, and accelerates research by reducing technical barriers.

The approach introduces several innovations. The log2 fold change based gene mapping method reconciles gene identifiers across annotation versions without requiring external mapping resources, works for any organism or annotation version, validates its own accuracy through correlation analysis, and achieved 100% mapping accuracy in our case studies. The pattern of AI-orchestrated Galaxy analysis uses natural language to define analyses, executes computations via Galaxy's API, maintains full reproducibility, and provides interpretation and validation. The three-layer architecture combining automated computation, AI assistance, and visual validation provides robust quality assurance through automated quantitative comparison, visual inspection, and biological consistency checking.

The success of this approach has implications beyond the specific case studies presented. For research practice, complex analyses become accessible to researchers without extensive computational training, reproducibility is inherently improved through automatic documentation and provenance tracking, cross-study comparison is facilitated by standardized processing, and focus can shift from technical details to biological questions. For scientific publishing, published results can be systematically validated by independent reanalysis, analysis methods can be fully documented enabling verification and replication, and standards for computational reproducibility can be raised across the field. For the use of AI in science, this work demonstrates productive human-AI collaboration, shows AI functioning as a scientific partner rather than replacement for human judgment, establishes patterns for responsible AI use, and points toward future developments in AI-assisted research.

We propose that the integration of AI assistance with established bioinformatics platforms represents a significant advance in how computational biology can be conducted. Galaxy provides validated methods, scalable infrastructure, and reproducibility guarantees. Claude Code provides cognitive flexibility, knowledge integration, and natural language interaction. Human researchers provide scientific judgment, creativity, and ultimate responsibility for conclusions. This synergy addresses many long-standing challenges in computational biology, from the reproducibility crisis to barriers posed by the expertise required for sophisticated analyses.

As AI capabilities continue to advance and bioinformatics platforms continue to evolve, we anticipate that this integrated approach will become increasingly powerful. The future of computational biology lies not in AI replacing human scientists, but in AI augmenting human capabilities—allowing researchers to ask bigger questions, analyze more data, and generate deeper insights than would otherwise be possible. By democratizing access to rigorous computational methods while maintaining scientific standards, this approach has the potential to accelerate discovery across fields that depend on transcriptomic analysis.
